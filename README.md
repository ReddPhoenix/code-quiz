## Project Overview

JavaScript quiz app with a countdown timer and point system based on correct answers. Correct answers have been assigned a 25 pt score. When timer runs to 0, points will stop counting and app will reload with next button click. Score will be saved to local storage and will be retrieved after the first game that is played.
